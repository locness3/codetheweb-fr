CSS display types tell the browser the way in which elements should be treated. Learn about the most common display types and how to use them in this article...

## Getting started
I think that it is best to learn by doing, so I highly recommend following along in all my tutorials. To follow along start by making a new project folder with `index.html` and `style.css` files in it. Add the following code to your `index.html`:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSS display types DEMO</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I am just some normal, innocent text.</p>
        Except here is a bit of text that is <div class="div1">different</div>, yay!
        <div class="div2">Now here's another div.</div>
        <p>And some more <span class="span1">normal</span> text.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
Open your `index.html` file in your browser - the content should pop up! We'll leave the `style.css` file blank for the moment.

## The display property
There are many values that the display property can have, but there are only about five that you need:
- `block`
- `inline`
- `flex`
- `grid`
- `none`

In this article, I'll be covering `block`, `inline` and `none`, which are the most common. In future articles I will be talking about `flex` (for [flexboxes][flex]) and `grid` (for [CSS grids][grid]), which are a bit more complicated.

Let's get started!

## display: block
To begin with, our website looks like this:
![The website opened from the initial code][initial-code]{:.screenshot-white}
Woah, what happened here?
```HTML
Except here is a bit of text that is <div class="div1">different</div>, yay!
```
The word `different` is on its own line! This is because a `<div>` has a default display type of `block`.

Elements with a display type of `block` are commonly called *block-level elements* and always start on a new line. They also take up the full width that they can (the equivalent of `width: 100%`). To see the block-magic in action, let's give our `<div>` a `background-color` in the `style.css` file:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: salmon;
}
```
And take a look at the result:
![The width of the div, highlighted in red (well okay, technically salmon)][block-width]{:.screenshot-white}

Yay! As you can see, our `<div>` takes up the whole screen because of it is a block-level element.

Okay, now its time to try making our own elements block-level! Take a look at this line in our HTML:
```HTML
<p>And some more <span class="span1">normal</span> text.</p>
```

What if we want to make the word `normal` on its own line, just like the word `different` from above? Simply set the `display` property to `block`:

```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: salmon;
}

.span1 {
    background-color: aquamarine;
    display: block;
}
```

Here is the result:
![The word normal is now like the word different, but aquamarine instead][new-block-element]{:.screenshot-white}

Woot! As you can see, the word `normal` is also displayed as a block-level element! "But why is it not displayed as `block` to begin with" you may ask? Well, the word `normal` is wrapped by a *`<span>`*, instead of a *`<div>`*. `<span>`s have a default display type of `inline`, because they are usually used to [wrap text][span] mid-sentence.

Now, let's learn what `display: inline` actually does!

## display: inline

Remember the word `different`? Well what if we want to make it part of the sentence, instead of on its own line? This is where `display: inline` comes into play.

The `inline` display type does not create a new line, and only takes up as much width as it needs (instead of the maximum).

So, let's try it out! Give our `.div1` an `inline` display type:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: salmon;
    display: inline;
}

.span1 {
    background-color: aquamarine;
    display: block;
}
```
![The word "different" is now like it would normally appear in a sentence.][inline-word]{:.screenshot-white}

Hoorah! Now, the word `different` is just a normal part of the sentence, and it doesn't take up the maximum width. This is the beauty of `display: inline`.

## display: none

Giving an element a display type of `none` makes it disappear completely from the page. No space is left for it, and other elements are positioned as if it were not there. Let's try it out on our `.div1`:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: salmon;
    display: none; /* Change this line */
}

.span1 {
    background-color: aquamarine;
    display: block;
}
```
![The word "different" has now dissapeared and no empty space has been left][display-none]{:.screenshot-white}

Now the word `different` has disappeared completely! Now you can see what I meant when I said that there is no space left for the missing element - the other words are positioned as if the word `different` never existed.

## display: none or visibility: hidden ?
`visibility: hidden` can also be used to hide elements. So what is the difference then?

Remember how I said above that `display: none` doesn't leave space for the missing element? Well `visibility: hidden` *does* leave space for the missing element. With `visibility: hidden`, it's like it is invisible but still there (you just can't see it), whereas with `display: none` the element isn't even there.

Enough explaining, let's try it out and see for ourselves! Change the `display` property of `.div1` back to `inline`, and then set the `visibility` property to `hidden`:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: salmon;
    display: inline;     /* Change this back to inline */
    visibility: hidden;  /* Add this line */
}

.span1 {
    background-color: aquamarine;
    display: block;
}
```
![Now the word "different" is still hidden, but there is a gap left for it][visibility-hidden]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, the rest of the page acts as if the word is still there - it is just invisible.

> ### Fun fact - Every element has a display type by default
> Believe it or not, every element has a display type - including elements in the `<head>` such as `<title>` and `<link>`, which have a display type of `none`!
