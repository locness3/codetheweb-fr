The CSS `position` property lets you position elements virtually anywhere you want. Learn how in this article...

## Getting started
I think that it is best to learn by doing, so I highly recommend following along in all my tutorials. To follow along start by making a new project folder with `index.html` and `style.css` files in it. Add the following code to your `index.html`:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSS position property DEMO</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>I am just some normal, innocent text :|</p>
        <div class="div1">Div 1</div>
        <div class="div2">Div 2</div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Next, add the following CSS to you `style.css` so that we can see our `<div>`s better:
```CSS
body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 5000px;
}
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
}

.div2 {
    background-color: magenta;
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
}
```
The reason for the `body` height is so that we can scroll on our page - you will see why this is relevant later in the tutorial. If you have a screen height that is larger than `5000px` and can't scroll, then seriously your screen is waaaaaaay too big &#128541;.

Cool! Now you're ready to go! Open your `index.html` in a web browser - it should look like this so far:
![A paragraph, a cyan portrait rectangle named Div 1 and a magenta square name Div 2][base-code-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Note that it may look slightly different based on your screen size and resoultion. Anyway, let's get going!

## Properties you will be learning
In this tutorial you will learn how to use:
- `position`
- `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`

All of these properties work together to give an element a specific position. When you use a `position` value other than the default, you can position it using the `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties.

## The top, bottom, left and right properties
These properties are used to position the element. It is positioned relative to different elements, based on what the `position` property of the element is (I'll explain that in a sec).
The `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties accept all [CSS units][units], but for this article we'll be using `px` (pixels).


## The position property
The `position` property accepts five values:
- `static`
- `fixed`
- `absolute`
- `relative`
- `sticky`

Let's go through what each of them do...

### position: static
`static` is the default position type. All elements have this position type unless you state otherwise, so you really don't need to worry about it - it is the default behaviour that you already know and you will almost never need to use it.

The `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties do not do anything to an element with a `position` of `static`.
### position: fixed
![The viewport - only the actual website part of the screen, not including the browser controls][viewport-img]
When an element has a `position` property of `fixed`, it is positioned relative to the viewport (see the image above, the viewport is highlighted in red).

What this means is that let's say an element has a `top` value of `100px`, it will be positioned `100px` from the top of the viewport. But what happens if you try scrolling down? It's still `100px` from the top of the screen. This means that an element with a `position` value of `fixed` stays in the same spot even when you scroll down!

Let's see the example I've talked about in action on our Div 1:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    position: fixed;    /* Add this line */
    top: 100px;         /* And this one  */
}
```

Add it to your CSS, reload the page and try scrolling down - Div 1 stays in the same spot on the screen!

![Div 1 stays in the same place on the screen even when scrolling][fixed-gif]{:.screenshot-white}

You will also notice that Div 1 covers part of Div 2 - I will deal with overlapping and layers a bit further down the page (let's get all the position types out of the way first).

Another thing to note is that Div 2 gets moved up, because **the `absolute` element is removed from the document flow.** This means that there is no space left for where the element would normally be.

### position: absolute
`absolute` positioning is positioned relative to one of its ancestors, instead of the viewport like with `position: fixed`.

**Wait what??? Ancestors??? Is this some ancient burial ritual????**

No, an ancestor is just one of the *parents* of an element. For example:
```HTML
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Hello</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

Here, the `<div>` and `<ul>` are both *ancestors* of the `<li>`.

**So, which ancestor does it use?** Well, it is positioned based on its closest ancestor with a `position` other than `static`. If there is not an ancestor that fits the criteria, it is positioned relative to the body element. _**Note that the `<body>` is different to the viewport, because it can be scrolled up and down (moved)**_.

> Absolute positioning can be a bit complicated, but don't dispair! Basically, `position: absolute` is positioned relative to the the body, unless an element that it's inside has a `position` value. Simplez!

To clear things up more, let's do an example - update your CSS file to give Div 1 a `position` of `absolute`:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    position: absolute;  /* Change this line from fixed */
    top: 100px;
}
```
Now save and reload the page:

![The page looks the same as with position: fixed][absolute-img]{:.screenshot-white}

What? But it looks the same! Exactly... Now Div 1 is relative to the `<body>` instead of the *viewport*. This means that it will look the same, but now it moves down when you scroll - try it yourself!

![Now Div 1 moves down the page when you scroll][absolute-gif]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, most of the time the difference between `fixed` and `absolute` is that `absolute` moves when you scroll but `fixed` doesn't - due to the reasons I talked about above.

### position: relative
`relative` positoning is very different to `absolute` and `fixed`. It is positioned relative to *itself*, instead of another element. Unlike `absolute` and `fixed`, with `relative` positioning the element is still a a part of the *document flow*.

Basically, the way that `relative` positioning is calculated is a two-step process:
1. Render the elements like normal (like it would look without a `position` value)
2. The element is moved based on its `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties (eg. `100px` to the downwards if it has `top: 100px`). Note that **the other elements do not move to fill any gaps or make way for the element, they stay where they are**. This creates an empty space the size of the element in the document flow.

Example time! Let's give Div 1 a `position` of `relative`:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    position: relative;  /* Change this line from absolute */
    top: 100px;
}
```

Save and reload the page, then take a look:
![Now Div 1 is like it was at the beginning but moved down 100px. Div 2 is still in the same spot regardless][relative-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Now the page is exactly the same as right at the beginning, except that Div 1 is moved down `100px`. If this was done by setting `margin-top: 100px` then Div 2 would have moved down as well, but because we are using `relative` positioning it stays in the same spot regardless!

Here is the difference visualized:
![A comparison between the default positioning and relative positioning][relative-comparison-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Let's continue!

### position: sticky
`position: sticky` actually just toggles between two of the other positioning types: `fixed` and `relative`. `position: sticky` is most commonly used with the `top` property, for cases when you want something to stick to the top of the viewport once you scroll past it.

First, let's look at an example. Change your CSS `position` attribute to `sticky`:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    position: sticky;  /* Change this line from relative */
    top: 0; /* Change this from 100px */
}
```

The reason that we are changing the `top` value to `0` is so that Div 1 will stick to the top once we scroll past it. Save, reload your page and see what happens...
<!--![Div 1 sticks to the top of the viewport once it is scrolled past][sticky-gif]-->

The element starts out with `relative` positioning, until the top of the element reaches `0px` from the top of the viewport (because of the `top` value of `0`). After that, the positioning becomes `fixed` with a `top` value of `0` (at the top of the screen).

Great job, now you know all the CSS `position` values and what they do! This was pretty complicated stuff, so if you're confused then you can go and read back through, or [ask for help in the comments][comments].

## Overlapping
This is the final thing that I will be covering in this article. Look back at the from above - you will see that Div 1 is overlapping Div 2. But what if you wanted Div 2 to overlap Div 1? The is where the `z-index` property comes into play.

The `z-index` accepts integers, both positive and negative. It doesn't support any types of units however. Also note that `z-index` only works on elements with a `position` property. By default, an element has a `z-index` of `0`.

So if we want to make our Div 2 overlap our Div 1, we will have to give Div 2 a higher `z-index`. We can do this either by setting the `z-index` of Div 2 to `1` or the `z-index` of Div 1 to `-1`. In this case because we've been styling Div 1, let's go with the second option.

Add a `z-index` of `-1` to your Div 1 styling:
```CSS
.div1 {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    z-index: -1;  /* Add this line */
}
```
Save, reload, scroll down a bit so the `<div>`s are overlapping and take a look:
![The pink Div 2 is now on top of the blue Div 1][z-index-img]{:.screenshot-white}

You will see that now Div 2 overlaps Div 1!
