Flexboxes are something that every web developer should know. They let you align, position and even re-order elements, using CSS alone! It is revolutionary, and lets us do some really cool stuff...

<!-- > Yup, that's right. Another punny cover image for today &#128540; -->

## Getting started
By following along, you will end up grasping this topic much better (and can also experiment!). To follow along, start by making a new project folder with `index.html` and `style.css` files in it. Add the following code to your `index.html`:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSS flexboxes DEMO</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="wrapper">
            <div class="inner_div" id="div1">Div 1</div>
            <div class="inner_div" id="div2">Div 2</div>
            <div class="inner_div" id="div3">Div 3</div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```
After that, add the following code to your `style.css` file:
```CSS
body {
    margin: 0;
}

#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
}

.inner_div {
    background-color: whitesmoke;
    padding: 15px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
}
```

Hopefully you should understand most (if not all) of this. First, we set the `<body>` margin to `0` - this is because the `<body>` has a default margin that can mess with positioning and sizing. After that we give our wrapper div> a `background-color`, and set its height to [`50vh`][vw-vh]. This means that it will take up 50% of the screen height.

Finally, we give each div inside the wrapper a `background-color` (so we can see them), some `padding` (for my sanity), a `border` (so we can see where their edges are) and a `width` and `height`.

Save your files, and open your `index.html` in a browser. If everything is working, it should look like this:
![The result of our base code][base-code]{:.screenshot-white}

Okay, let's get on to the fun part!

## What is a flexbox?
A flexbox is made up of a parent element (which in our case is `<div id="wrapper">`) with at least one child element inside it.
![Our parent element with child elements inside it][flexbox-structure]{:.screenshot-white}

## Creating a flexbox
The thing is, our wrapper is actually not a flexbox yet! We need to tell the browser to make it a flexbox using `display: flex`. Let's do so in our CSS:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex; /* Add this line */
}
```
Result:
![The elements are now ordered horizontally!][display-flex]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, the elements have now been ordered horizontally instead of vertically! By default, children of a flexbox are ordered horizontally unless otherwise specified (we'll get into this further down).

There we go! Now we've created a flexbox! Let's start doing stuff with it...

## The justify-content property
The `justify-content` property is used to horizontally align the items within the flexbox. Let's take a look at the values and what they do...

### justify-content: center
`justify-content: center` does exactly what you think - it centers all the items within the flexbox. Let's try it out:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center; /* Add this line */
}
```
Result:
![The items are centered within the wrapper div][justify-content-center]{:.screenshot-white}
It's that simple!

### justify-content: flex-start
`justify-content: flex-start` aligns the items to the left of the flexbox. Let's try it out:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-start; /* Change this line */
}
```
Result:
![The items are left-aligned within the wrapper div][display-flex]{:.screenshot-white}
As you can see, the items are now aligned to the left edge of the flexbox (the 'start' of the flexbox, hence the name `flex-start`).

### justify-content: flex-end
`justify-content: flex-end` is the same as `flex-start`, except it aligns the items to the right edge (the 'end' of the flexbox). Let's update our CSS and see what happens:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end; /* Change this line */
}
```
Result:
![The items are right-aligned within the wrapper div][justify-content-flex-end]{:.screenshot-white}

### justify-content: space-around
`justify-content: space-around` spaces the items in the flexbox so that each item has the same amount of space *around* it. Let's try it out to get a better understanding:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around; /* Change this line */
}
```
![The items all have an even amount of space AROUND them][justify-content-space-around]{:.screenshot-white}

Here is a diagram so you can visualize the spacing easier - you will see that there is the same amount of space surrounding each item:

![The items all have an even amount of space around them (diagram)][justify-content-space-around-diagram]{:.screenshot-white}


### justify-content: space-between
`justify-content: space-between` spaces the items with an even amount of space *between* them instead of with an even amount of space *around* them. This can seem confusing at first, but once we try it the difference is clear. So, let's try it and see:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between; /* Change this line */
}
```
Result:

![The items all have an even amount of space BETWEEN them)][justify-content-space-between]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see there is a big difference between `space-around` and `space-between`! This diagram will help you visualize how `space-between` is different:

![The items all have an even amount of space between them (diagram)][justify-content-space-between-diagram]{:.screenshot-white}

Now the space *between* the items is equal, but not the space *around* each one.

### justify-content: space-evenly
Really? Another one of those `space` properties? Yep, that's right - `justify-content: space-evenly` is like `space-between`, but includes the sides. This means that the space between each item is the same, but is also the same as the space between the outer items and the edges. Let's try it and see what happens:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly; /* Change this line */
}
```
Result:

![The items all have an even amount of space between them, and also to the edges][justify-content-space-evenly]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, the spaces between each item as well as the spaces between the items and the edges are equal. This diagram will (hopefully) clear things up a bit:

![The items all have an even amount of space between them, and also to the edges (diagram)][justify-content-space-evenly-diagram]{:.screenshot-white}

Although it may look deceptively like `space-around`, it is actually not. Here is a comparison of their spacing:

![space-around and space-evenly are actually very different][justify-content-space-around-evenly-comparison]{:.screenshot-white}

Phew! That's all the stuff on `justify-content` done - hopefully it wasn't too confusing! While there is still more to cover in this article, don't worry - it's not all this complicated! Let's move on to something different now...

> NOTE: There are more values for `justify-content`, but these are the only ones that you really need to care about.

## The align-items property
The `align-items` property is used to align the items vertically within the flexbox. It accepts the values of `center`, `flex-start` and `flex-end`. You already know what these do! However, note that because it is vertical, `flex-start` is aligned to the top instead of the left, and `flex-end` is aligned to the bottom instead of the right. Let's try one out:
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    align-items: center; /* Add this line */
}
```
Result:
![The items are now centered vertically!][align-items-center]{:.screenshot-white}

And here is what `flex-start` and `flex-end` look like:
![align-items: flex-start and align-items: flex-end][align-items-flex-start-flex-end]{:.screenshot-white}

Just keep in mind that you cannot use `space-around`, `space-between` and `space-evenly` as values for the `align-items` property.


> NOTE: There are more values for `align-items` as well, but these are the only ones that you really need to care about.

## Perfect centering!
In the dark old days before flexboxes, centering something both vertically and horizontally was a pain, and required ugly hacks. Luckily, now its as simple as giving the parent three lines of CSS!

**(don't add this to your current CSS file, but you can play around later if you want &#128521;)**
```CSS
#parent {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
This is just one of the many awesome uses for flexboxes.

Moving on!

## The flex-wrap property

What happens if your items are wider and can't all fit on one line? Let's have a look - change the width of `.inner_div` to `600px`:
```CSS
.inner_div {
    background-color: whitesmoke;
    padding: 15px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    width: 600px; /* Change this line */
    height: 50px;
}
```
Result:
![The items are still all on one line, and have been shrunk!][items-too-wide]{:.screenshot-white}
As you can see, the items all stay on the one line and take up the maximum width that they are allowed to (only `422px`, which is a lot less than `600px`!).

> NOTE: These dimensions might be different based on your screen width.

Heck, you can even set the width to `100000000px` and it will still take up the same amount of space! (you can try if you're not convinced).

If we want to make the items go onto a new line if they are too big, we can use the `flex-wrap` property - try it out!

**(if you set the width to `100000000px`, change it back to `600px` first)**
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    align-items: center;
    flex-wrap: wrap; /* Add this line */
}
```
Result:
![Yay, the items go over onto multiple lines now!][flex-wrap]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, the items are now bigger (their actual size, `600px`).

`flex-wrap` also allows us to create layouts that adapt to multiple screen sizes - this is called [*responsive design*][responsive]. Take a look:
![The page adapts to different screen sizes][flex-wrap-responsive]{:.screenshot-white}

This way, the items never resize weirdly or go off the edge of the screen.

> ## Back to normal...
> Before continuing, let's put our demo back to normal:
> ```CSS
> body {
>     margin: 0;
> }
> 
> #wrapper {
>     background-color: deepskyblue;
>     height: 50vh;
>     display: flex;
>     justify-content: space-evenly;
>     align-items: flex-start;
>     /* Remove the flex-wrap line */
> }
> 
> .inner_div {
>     background-color: whitesmoke;
>     padding: 15px;
>     border: 2px solid black;
>     width: 50px; /* Change this back to 50px */
>     height: 50px;
> }
> ```

## The flex-direction property
The whole time our items have been going *horizontally*. But what if we wanted to make them go *vertically*?

This is what the `flex-direction` property is for. Let's try making our items go vertically...
```CSS
#wrapper {
    background-color: deepskyblue;
    height: 50vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    align-items: flex-start;
    flex-direction: column; /* Add this line */
}
```
Result:
![The items are now arrange vertically][flex-direction-column]{:.screenshot-white}

There is a massive thing that you need to remember though - **When using `flex-direction: column`, `justify-content` and `align-items` are reversed.** Here is a diagram:

![align-items and justify-content are reversed][flex-direction-axes]{:.screenshot-white}

This is very confusing! However, you will just have to get used to it - just remember that when you rotate the direction, you rotate the properties as well.

## The order property
> First of all, remove your `flex-direction: column` line - it will get in the way for demoing this property:
> ```CSS
> #wrapper {
>     background-color: deepskyblue;
>     height: 50vh;
>     display: flex;
>     justify-content: space-evenly;
>     align-items: flex-start;
>     /* Remove the flex-direction line */
> }
> ```

Okay, let's get going... This is our final property for today!

Remember at the start of the article how I mentioned that you can actually *re-order HTML elements* using CSS flexboxes? Well, this is how. It is revolutionary to be able to re-order elements - previously, you had to do some ugly `position` hacks that could break easily under certain conditions. So, how do we do it?

Unlike the other properties so far, the `order` property applies to the actual *items*, instead of the parent wrapper. The `order` property takes any integer as a value.

When ordering items in a flexbox, each item has a *position*. The first item is at position `0`, the second is at position `1` etc. (most lists in programming start at `0` instead of `1`)

Let's try and make the order become Div 2, Div 1, Div 3. Here's how we can do this:
```CSS
#div1 {
    order: 1;
}
#div2 {
    order: 0;
}
#div3 {
    order: 2;
}
```
Result:
![The order is now Div 2, Div 1, Div 3][order-213]{:.screenshot-white}

Yay! Now our order has been changed! This is the beauty of the `order` property - it can change the order of the elements on the screen, using only CSS!

You can play around with the order a bit more now if you want.

## Game Time! &#128377;&#128377;&#128377; &#128056;
If you want to reinforce what you've learned today and have a bit of geeky fun, I highly recommend you go and play [Flexbox Froggy][flexbox-froggy].

It was actually one of the first places that I found out about flexboxes when I was learning, and it was really helpful.

Also, if you want to see some things that are possible with flexboxes, take a look at these [flexbox examples][examples].

But don't go yet! We still need to do the conclusion bit where I ask you to be nice and [share this][share] and congratulate you even though I probably don't actually know you!
