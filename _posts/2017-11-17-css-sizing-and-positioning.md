One of the most important parts of CSS is setting the size and positioning of elements. I'll show you all that in this article...

## Getting started
Make a new project folder with `index.html` and `style.css` files in it. Add the following code to your `index.html`:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSS sizing and positioning DEMO</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent finibus fermentum mi vitae sollicitudin. Proin tempus enim nisl, eu rutrum ipsum venenatis sit amet. In non justo nec eros blandit mattis. Proin tempus ex lorem, id vulputate felis rhoncus facilisis. Aliquam quis pharetra metus.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
{:.wrap}

To demonstrate the properties I'll explain today, lets give the `<p>` a [`background-color`][bg-color]{:target='blank'}. Put the following in your CSS:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
}
```
Open up your `index.html` file in a web browser - it should look like this:

![A paragraph with a cyan background][initial-code]{:.screenshot-white}

Cool! Now we're ready to go!


> **NOTE:**
> The screenshots that I have taken in this tutorial are taken on my computer. Your results might look different compared to the overall screen size depending on the amount of pixels on your monitor.

## Basic sizing properties
First, let's lean how to set the *dimensions* of an element. It is fairly simple: just use the `width` and `height` properties. The values for the `width` and `height` properties must be in units. For this tutorial we will use the most simple units, `px` (pixels). For example:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 300px;
}
```
I will talk about many more types of units in [this article][units]. Try adding the `width` property to your stylesheet like above. Reload your browser window and see what happens:

![The paragraph but only taking up a part of the screen width][width-img]{:.screenshot-white}

The `height` property works in a very similar way. Try setting your `height` property to `400px` and see what happens:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
}
```
Result:

![The paragraph with a larger height than before][height-img]{:.screenshot-white}

As you can see, the `height` of our paragraph is now much larger. Moving on...

## Margin
What if we wanted to move our paragraph over to the right a bit? Or down a bit? This is where the `margin` property comes into play.

There are multiple `margin`-related properties:
- `margin`: sets the same margin on all sides of an element
- `margin-left`: sets the margin to the left of an element
- `margin-right`: sets the margin to the right of an element
- `margin-top`: sets the margin above an element
- `margin-bottom`: sets the margin below an element

Think of `margin` as the space around the element, that no-one can enter. Kind of like an invisible force-field. If there is an element in its force-field, it just gets shifted down - but still retains the same amount of free space around it.

Let's try it out by adding a `margin-left` of `200px` to our paragraph:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
    margin-left: 200px;
}
```
Reload your page and see what happens:

![The paragraph moved over 200px to the right][margin-left-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Yay! Now our paragraph has been moved over `200px` to the right! This is because there is an invisible force-field of free space `200px` wide to the left of the element, pushing it to the right:

![The margin-left un-invisibleized][margin-left-force-field-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Try adding a `margin-top` to our paragraph as well, to push it *downwards* by `100px`. See if you can guess what the CSS will look like:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
    margin-left: 200px;
    margin-top: 100px;
}
```
{:.reveal}

Preview your code. Now, your web-page should look like this:
![The paragraph moved 100px down][margin-top-img]{:.screenshot-white}

![The margin-top and margin-left un-invisibleized][margin-top-force-field-img]{:.screenshot-white}

There we go! Now you know all about `margin`s!

## Padding
So far, our text is bunched up right against the edges of the cyan rectangle (see the images above). This looks ugly! But wait... `padding` to the rescue!

Just like `margin`, there are multiple `padding`-related properties:
- `padding`: sets the same padding on all sides of an element
- `padding-left`: sets the padding on the left of an element
- `padding-right`: sets the padding on the right of an element
- `padding-top`: sets the padding on the top an element
- `padding-bottom`: sets the padding on the bottom an element

But what is `padding`? `padding` is like `margin` except inside the element instead of outside the element. It is free space inside the element, and is often used to stop stuff from being right at the edge of an element (like our text!)

Let's fix our text by giving it a `padding` property of `50px`. Note that we are using `padding`, not `padding-left` etc. because we don't want the text to hit *any* of the edges. See if you can work out what our CSS should look like:
```CSS
p {
    background-color: cyan;
    width: 300px;
    height: 400px;
    margin-left: 200px;
    margin-top: 100px;
    padding: 50px;
}
```
{:.reveal}

Now, update your CSS file and reload the page...
![The paragraph, but now the text is not touching the sides][padding-img]{:.screenshot-white}

Here is where the padding (and margins) are:
![The margin-top, margin-left and padding un-invisibleized][padding-force-field-img]{:.screenshot-white}

You will notice that the empty space where the padding is still has a blue background - this is because the empty space is *inside* the element, so that part also has a blue background.

One thing to be careful of is that the padding and margin are _**NOT**_ part of the `width` and `height` of an element - so often an element will appear wider or higher than its actual `width` or `height`.

## Conclusion
Well done! We covered some pretty big concepts today, so congrats if you were able to get your head around them. If not, have a look through again and if you need any help then you can [ask in the comments below][comments] and I'll be happy to help (by the way, if you have any feedback you can [tell me there too][comments]).
